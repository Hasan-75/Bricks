# 🧱 Bricks
*Yet another unnecessary console game*

---

### 💡 Inspiration
After watching the *[Tetris (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12758060/)* movie, I was fascinated by the story of how Alexey Pajitnov, a Russian programmer, created Tetris in 1984.
He built the game on a computer without a graphics card, relying entirely on keyboard characters like square brackets for visuals.

This motivated me to take an attempt and build this console version of the **[Bricks](https://dosgames.com/game/break-machine/)** game, which I used to play in my childhood.
